# My Journey Through Proximus' Graduate Program
In September 2023, after completing my engineering degree, I decided to join Proximus as a technical graduate. I knew I wanted to complement my technical background with broader business experience, and Belgium's largest telecom operator was the right place for this. What I didn't expect was how much three rotations through product management and strategy focusing on AI and Security would reshape the way I work.


## Fraud & Security at BICS
My first rotation threw me into product management at Proximus's international carrier service BICS. For eight months, I worked on all aspects of the product lifecycle, from exploring opportunities to create new innovative products, to tracking product development and building partnerships. I really got to see all aspects of product management, gaining hands-on experience in key skills such market research, building business cases and technical reviews.

## AI Strategy at Proximus Ada
For my second rotation, I shifted to Proximus Ada, Proximus's AI division. Here, instead of owning products, I got to work on a broad series of strategic projects, ranging from an AI productization exercise to researching agentic AI applications for the telecom industry. With great minds across the workfloor, Proximus Ada was a great place to work.

## Streamlining Operations
In my final rotation, I returned to Proximus, joining the operational excellence strategy team. Here I was tasked with optimizing a network product line. From market research and analysing the operational model to financial modelling of costs. This project taught me a lot about collecting data from across the organization and combining them into strategic insights allowing us to prioritize improvements 

## What I Learned
The graduate program gave me something most traditional engineering roles wouldn't: a broad perspective with deepdives in critical areas. I learned how to manage complex projects without clear directions or straightforward solutions and transitioned from a computer science engineer to a professional at the intersection of technology and real-world impact. Looking forward to what's next!

In the final year of my master's, I joined Optioryx as a job student. This start-up company specialises in AI-powered packing solutions that help companies reduce their transportation costs and archieve sustainability goals. 

I'm very grateful for this experience, as I got to work side-by-side with some of the most talented engineers I have ever met. Give their website a visit a [optioryx.com](https://optioryx.com), I honestly belief that most companies would benefit from their services.

During my time at the company, I mainly focused on optimizing their 3D-bin-packing algorithm. I explored edge cases where the algorithm did not perform as expected and proposed a new data structure that could help optimize the algorithm. As far as my knowledge goes, Optioryx still used this data structure today.

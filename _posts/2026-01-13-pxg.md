#### Current Role

In September 2025, I rejoined Proximus's international division, which has now been renamed Proximus Global, focusing on delivering digital communication solutions across their Connect, Engage, and Protect portfolio.

As GTM Specialist for Security solutions, I take ownership of our go-to-market strategy, bridging the gap between deeply technical products and customer value. This role offers a unique opportunity to develop both my technical depth and commercial acumen while enabling sales teams to effectively communicate complex security solutions.

It's an exciting next step that combines strategic thinking with hands-on market exposure, allowing me to grow at the intersection of product expertise and customer engagement.

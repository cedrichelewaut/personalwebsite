As a participant in the two-year rotational program at the Proximus Group, an international provider of communication and digital services operating in Belgium and beyond, I am looking to enhance my technical background with profound business knowledge.

### 1. Product Manager for Transactional Security at BICS (09/2023 - 04/2024)

BICS is a leading global communications company that provides secure and reliable connectivity solutions to customers worldwide. As a Product Manager for Transactional Security, I managed current solutions for preventing fraud and proposed a new initiative that **leverages machine learning to secure connectivity**. I also took the lead in **partnership discussions** and provided advice on how to **leverage the data available at BICS in a privacy compliant manner**. 

### 2. AI Strategy Expert at Proximus ADA (05/2024 - 12/2024)

Proximus ADA is Belgium's first center of excellence combining AI and Cybersecurity. As AI strategy expert, I will focus on **identifying high potential use cases for AI** within the Proximus Group.


### 3. TBD (01/2025 - 08/2025)
The final rotation of my graduate program still needs to be determined.

#### Student Role at a Growing Start-up

In the final year of my master's, I joined Optioryx as a student employee. This start-up specializes in AI-powered packing solutions that help companies reduce transportation costs and achieve sustainability goals.

I had a great time collaborating with some of the brightest engineers of my generation. Be sure to visit their website at [optioryx.com](https://optioryx.com) to see the amazing work they're doing.

#### My Contribution

During my time at the company, I focused on optimizing their 3D bin-packing algorithm. I explored edge cases where the algorithm underperformed and proposed a new data structure to improve its efficiency. As far as I know, Optioryx still uses this data structure today.

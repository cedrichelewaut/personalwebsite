Throughout the 2021-2022 academic year, I joined the first edition of the Innovation for Society excellence program at Ghent university. A program that allows future engineers to explore their role in achieving a postive and lasting impact on the world. 

For the program, the participating students were divided into four smaller groups with each group receiving a specific case. On a regular basis everybody came together for a guest lecture and to present the progress of their casework. I really enjoyed this program as you interact with a veriety of engineers, ranging from specializations in architecture to computer science.

The case my team got to tackle related to racial bias in facial recognition systems. With more and more innovative technologies being deployed in the justice system and applications related to national security, it is important that we only deploy those if they can offer a fair judgement for all. On first sight, this seems feasible, but this certainly isn't always the case in the real world. Aspects such as racial bias in training data, or unbalanced data sets can expose innocent people to significant risks. 

Throughout the project, we indicated the presence of racial bias in facial recognition systems and we proposed a series of mitigation techniques including the use of synthetic data.

I am currently taking part in a two year rotational program at the Proximus Group, Belgium's leading provider of communication and digital services. My goal for this program is to gain profound business skills to complement my technical background.

### 1. Product Manager for Transactional Security at BICS
During my first eight months at the group, I got to explore the worlds of product management and cybersecurity. I joined the transactional security team at BICS where products are developped to secure customers and to prevent fraudulent activity. 

I am grateful for the trust my collegues put in me, which allowed me to learn a lot of new things.


### 2. and 3. Next assignments TBD
For now, I do not know what my next assignment will be, but I am curious to what the future holds.

## Volunteering with IZG
In 2024, I decided to attend a meeting of Belgium's Engineering Without Borders iniative. Being captured by how the organization brings together a community of engineers who want to work on projects that create a lasting impact on the world was inspiring to see. I immediately decided to become a member of the organization. Currently I am supporting a clean water project in Somaliland and manage the social media channels of the organization. 

## Actively looking for members
If you are an engineer looking to make a positive impact, feel free to reach out to me or explore IZG on our website: [IZG.be](https://izg.be).

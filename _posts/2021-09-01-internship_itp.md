In the summer of 2021, I decided to apply for my first internship as a computer science engineer. Having heard a lot of great things about the company already, I reached out to In The Pocket, and before I knew it I was spending part of my summer in their Machine Learning (ML) team.

I learned a lot during my time at In The Pocket, from my first steps in data analytics to and introduction with generative AI. One main take-away for me was the importance between innovative technologies and human creativity. Reflecting on this now, I have only seen this being confirmed in my more recent experiences. Learning how to work with new technologies can be tough by itself, but you won't differentiate yourself if you cannot come up with creative ways on how to deploy them.

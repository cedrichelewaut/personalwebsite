As a participant in the two-year rotational program at the Proximus Group, an international provider of communication and digital services operating in Belgium and beyond, I am looking to enhance my technical background with profound business knowledge.

### 1. Product Manager for Transactional Security at BICS

BICS is a leading global communications company that provides secure and reliable connectivity solutions to customers worldwide. As a Product Manager for Transactional Security, I managed current solutions for preventing fraud and proposed a new initiative that **leverages machine learning to secure connectivity**. I also took the lead in **partnership discussions** and provided advice on how to **leverage the data available at BICS in a privacy compliant manner**. 

### 2. and 3. Next assignments TBD
For now, I do not know what my next rotations will be, but I am curious to what the future holds.

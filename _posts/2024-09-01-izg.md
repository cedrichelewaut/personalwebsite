#### Making an Impact

In 2024, I attended a meeting of Belgium's Engineering Without Borders initiative. I was inspired by how the organization brings together a community of engineers working on projects that create lasting impact on the world. I immediately decided to become a member.

Currently, I support a clean water project in Somaliland and manage the social media channels of the organization.

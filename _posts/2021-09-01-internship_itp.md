#### Summer 2021 Internship

In the summer of 2021, I worked with the Machine Learning team at In The Pocket, a digital product studio based in Ghent. My role focused on applying Machine Learning and Data Science to real-world challenges. I contributed to client projects and developed a personal project using internal data to provide insights on team dynamics to team leads.

For a deeper dive into the main project, check out my blog post on the In The Pocket website: [How Data Science Helps Us Grow as a Company](https://www.inthepocket.com/blog/how-data-science-helps-us-grow-as-a-company).

#### Acknowledgements
I would like to thank Rémi Delanghe for his guidance during the internship.

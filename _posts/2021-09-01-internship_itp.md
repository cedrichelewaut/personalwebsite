In the summer of 2021, I decided to apply for my first internship as a computer science engineer. I reached out to In The Pocket, and before I knew it I was spending part of my summer in their Machine Learning (ML) team.

I learned a lot during my time at In The Pocket, from data anlytics fundamentals to exploring the capabilities of generative AI. One key takeaway of this internship was that you get the most out of **innovative technologies** if you approach them with a **creative mindset**. 

Throughout more recent projects I have frequently been reminded of this lesson. Learning how to work with new technologies can be tough by itself, but you won't differentiate if you cannot come up with creative ways on how to deploy them to real-life problems.

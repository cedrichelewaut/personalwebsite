for my master thesis, I explored how Machine Learning (ML) can help find connection between immersion in multimedia content and physiological signals. The main focus of the study was on modelling with electroencephalograms (EEGs), but electrocardiograms (ECGs) were also explored briefly due to their more simplistic nature.


#### Main Contributions:
- Accurate EEG classification of objective conditions: The research showed that EEG data can clearly distinguish between the cases where users are watching content in objectively different settings.
- Accurate EEG classification of subjective ratings: The research also showed that EEG data can accurately predict when a user will evaluate an experience as immersive.



#### Implications
My master thesis emphasizes the feasibility of modeling cognitive processes like immersion using EEGs. The findings pave the way for personalized immersive experiences in evolving multimedia formats.

In the final year of my master's, I joined Optioryx as a job student. This start-up company specialises in AI-powered packing solutions that help companies reduce their transportation costs and archieve sustainability goals. 

I had a great time here, collaborating with some of the brightest engineers of my generation. Be sure to give their website a visit at [optioryx.com](https://optioryx.com). They are always up to amazing things!

During my time at the company, I mainly focused on optimizing their 3D-bin-packing algorithm. I explored edge cases where the algorithm did not perform as expected and proposed a new data structure that could help optimize the algorithm. As far as my knowledge goes, Optioryx still uses this data structure today.
